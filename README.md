## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a cloud engineer specializing in Kubernetes and container orchestration, with a strong focus on building scalable, resilient, and efficient cloud-native applications. This repository serves as a showcase for my projects, tools, and resources related to Kubernetes, containerization, and cloud infrastructure management.

With extensive experience in Kubernetes, I work on automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across cloud environments. My expertise spans both managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS and Google GKE, as well as self-hosted Kubernetes clusters. I focus on implementing best practices for application architecture, security, and performance tuning to ensure high availability and fault tolerance in production environments.

In addition to Kubernetes, I have hands-on experience with containerization technologies like Docker, which I use to create lightweight, portable environments for microservices and distributed applications. Iâ€™m passionate about building CI/CD pipelines for seamless integration and deployment, ensuring that code is delivered rapidly and reliably to production.

Monitoring and observability are also core to my work. I integrate tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting, helping teams maintain visibility and quickly respond to issues. I also work on scaling applications efficiently, leveraging Kubernetesâ€™ native autoscaling features and optimizing resource utilization to ensure cost-effective operations.

This repository includes examples of Kubernetes configurations, Helm charts, deployment scripts, and monitoring setups. My goal is to share knowledge, demonstrate best practices, and contribute to the cloud-native community.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out for collaboration. Iâ€™m always open to discussing cloud infrastructure, containerization, and Kubernetes.

Thanks for visiting!
